# Habituation probability

This software will allow you to plot habituation probability graphs and generate 
statistical comparisons between groups (if there are multiple groups) using data from the
Multi-worm tracker (MWT; Swierczek et al., 2011). 


## Figures it generates
* Reversal probability versus stimulus (plotted on x-axis as time of presentation)
* 95% confidence intervals (Clopper Pearson method) for reversal probability

## Statistics reported (if multiple groups)
* Logistic regression comparing final reversal probability between groups.


## How to use it

* Put your unzipped MWT experiment folders inside an experiment directory in the project's 
data directory

* In the Shell, set the working directory to project's root directory 
(`Habituation_probability/`)

* Call `bin/habituation_probability_driver.sh` from the Bash Shell

* `habituation_probability_driver.sh` requires the following arguments from the user: 
(1) absolute path to `chore.jar` (offline analys program Choreography), (2) gigabytes of 
memory to be used to run Choreography (dependent upon the machine you are using, (3) type 
of stimulus and (4) relative path to the directory where your data is stored 
(e.g., `data/Experiment_1`).
